[L1] (60) Line 126: this is the reference to "git ingest" that I mentioned. it seems analogous to the idea I had for freeze-drying our chat content from a project to make it into three levels of file: churn, built and works, and strategy. Then my idea was to save it to a website that would be made visible to the agent for a given window (maybe white-label the agent's URL)? and the agent could ingest the salient points from the chat. Now that I look at it it has his name in the URL so maybe it;s not happening, but it's still just an idea that he is presenting. But the words he says are "you just change the url to gitingest and it concatenates and creates a directory that is ready for ingest into an LLM."

[L1] (60) Line 184: I think i better leave that to the experts. Seems like Karpathy is halfway there. seems to me my process is a way of filtering for rlevance and compressing a chat session or series of sessions. Maybe something like a protocol or an algorythm that is potentially make-able into an open-source tool for chat/token/session efficiency. Like, I want to do it but my mind is vulnerable to burnout and I already have a ful time job and three websites I'm building.

[L1] (60) Line 868: I think I would like the set to be reviewable as a "set", so maybe the zip file idea makes sense. Not sure. The keyword files could definitely grow. But instead of getting carried away, let's finish this up and make it downloadable, then talk about what to do with it.
[L1] (60) Line 883: I feel kike this doesn't intuitively fit into any of the Git repos I have already. It's its own thing. Maybe the thing to do is start a repo for this idea and, if it has a .md file at the root of the repo, then I could simply ask someone like Cursor to go look and build in the repo, then once the product seems ready clone it to a droplet and start using it like that? do people build that way, or is that backwards?
