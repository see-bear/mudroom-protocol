## 🧠 July 1, 2025 — Version 5 Release

- ✨ Introduced `mudroom_sorter_v5.py`:
  - Parses all `.txt` files in `batch_txts/`
  - Extracts **latest date mentioned in the text** (not file metadata)
  - Saves to `mudroom_logs/YYYY-MM-DD-filename-LX.md`
  - Includes emoji-tagging (e.g. ✅ = L2, 🎯 = L3, 🐛 = L1, 🧠 = L3)
- 🔁 Added `run_mudroom_sort_v5.bat` for Windows users
- 📦 Added `requirements.txt` for clean setup

Use case: drop your raw `.txt` logs in `batch_txts/`, double-click the `.bat`, and commit the outputs.

# The Mud Room

*A Human-AI Process for Meaningful Forgetting and Intentional Remembering*

---

## 🌱 Purpose

Modern human-AI collaboration often produces large volumes of valuable but noisy chat data. The Mud Room Protocol offers a structured process for curating, tagging, and reusing conversation history in a way that:

* Preserves **strategic insight**
* Filters **noise and churn**
* Enables **efficient reloading of context**
* Protects **intellectual property**

The metaphor is intentional: a *mud room* is where we pause, sort, and clean before and after venturing out on a random walk. This protocol is that cognitive space.

## 🧱 Layered Memory Model

| Level                                   | Purpose           | Contents                                                      | Usage          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Level 3: Vision**                     | Strategic anchor  | Decisions, intentions, design philosophy                      | Always loaded  |
| **Level 2: Lessons & Creation Logging** | Validated insight | What worked vs. failed, build methodology, freeze-dried state | Load on demand |
| **Level 1: General/Churn**              | Worklog & noise   | Debug logs, trials, exploration, side threads                 | Archived only  |

---

## 🔧 Workflow Overview

1. **Session Ends**

   * Classify content into Level 1/2/3
   * Optional: tag lines in real time during chat

2. **Create Output Files**

   * `L3-strategy.md`
   * `L2-lessons.md`
   * `L1-churn.json` or `.log` (flexible)

3. **Store**

   * Private repo or encrypted cloud bucket
   * Structure:

     ```
     /mudroom/
       ├── 2025-06-30/
       │     ├── L3-strategy.md
       │     ├── L2-lessons.md
       │     └── L1-churn.log
       └── keywords/
             ├── level1.txt
             ├── level2.txt
             └── level3.txt
     ```

4. **Next Session**

   * AI loads only L3 (and optionally L2)
   * Stays focused on current priorities

---

## 🧠 Conversational Tagging

Rather than post-session tagging only, users and AI can:

* Use inline phrases to mark intent ("Tag this as Level 2: Creation insight")
* Reference or edit keyword banks over time
* Develop shared tagging vocabulary

This turns the session into a **live context-sorting process**.

---

## 🗂️ Keyword Banks

Each Level is supported by an evolving keyword file that helps with auto-sorting:

```
/keywords/level1.txt   # e.g. debug, error, try, bug, fix, retry
/keywords/level2.txt   # lesson, worked, confirmed, pattern, learning
/keywords/level3.txt   # decide, commit, strategy, vision, direction
```

These files are editable, contextual, and project-specific. They may also be forked per **domain or vertical** (e.g. `/finance/`, `/ops/`, `/engineering/`) to reflect context-specific language.

---

## 🧩 Flexible Level 1 Formats

Level 1 may use any format appropriate to:

* Team size
* Security needs
* Tooling
* Industry constraints

| Format           | Use Case                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `.log`, `.md`    | Developers or solo workflows                |
| `.json`, `.csv`  | Team collaboration, import/export needs     |
| `.enc`, `.vault` | Secure environments or regulated industries |

---

## 🛤️ Future Extensions

* CLI tools to tag and split sessions automatically
* VS Code or Obsidian plugins for mudroom-mode
* Integration into LLM chat wrappers (e.g. `loadLevel3()`)

---

## 🏁 Summary

The Mud Room Protocol offers a human-AI bridge between freeform creativity and structured memory. It’s a system for:

* Thinking clearly
* Remembering intentionally
* Building iteratively

This protocol welcomes contributions.

*“Every good project starts with a muddy pair of boots.”*

## 📎 Appendix: Heuristic Tagging & Conversational Markers

### 🔍 Heuristic-Based Scoring

| Match Type          | Score | Rule                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Tag**      | 100%  | Line starts with `strategy:`, `work:`, or `churn:`                                 |
| **Close Proximity** | 75%   | Two keywords (from different levels) occur in the same paragraph or within N words |
| **Loose Mention**   | 60%   | Any one keyword appears, but not clearly marked or nearby another                  |
| **No match**        | 0%    | No recognized signals                                                              |

### 🗂️ Conversational Parse Markers

Used to chunk dialogue into meaningful sections:

| Marker Phrase                | Role                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `I'm back`                   | New block or session start |
| `sleep well` / `signing off` | Block end                  |
| `next task:` / `new goal:`   | Task delimiter             |
| `by the way`                 | Side-thread indicator      |
| `so anyway`                  | Pivot or redirection       |

These can help future tooling or models detect structural intent and segment memory accordingly.

## 📎 Appendix: Starter Keyword Files

### 🔑 level1.txt – General/Churn

```
debug
retry
failed
error
trace
temp
attempt
maybe
check again
broken
```

### 🔑 level2.txt – Lessons & Creation Logging

```
lesson
verified
realized
confirmed
build pattern
in hindsight
creation logging
revised
freeze-dried
worked
```

### 🔑 level3.txt – Strategy & Vision

```
strategy
vision
direction
we will
committed to
next phase
architectural
goal
finalized
decision
```

These keyword files can be copied and adapted per project. Over time, they can evolve as teams refine their tagging behavior.

---

## 📎 Appendix: Scoring Script Logic (Sketch)

A future CLI script might follow logic like this:

```python
# Pseudocode for Mud Room scoring and tagging

def score_line(line, level_keywords):
    if line.startswith(('strategy:', 'work:', 'churn:')):
        return 100
    match_count = sum(kw in line for kw in level_keywords)
    if match_count >= 2:
        return 75
    if match_count == 1:
        return 60
    return 0
```

This scoring logic could be applied line-by-line or chunk-by-chunk to automatically split session logs into levels. Chunking would be further improved by using the **Conversational Parse Markers** described above.
